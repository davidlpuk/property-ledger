# Spanish Landlord Tax and Compliance Requirements 2025-2026

> **Brief:**
> Spanish landlords face a complex regulatory landscape in 2025-2026, with the Veri*Factu e-invoicing mandate delayed to January 2027, while SII real-time VAT reporting continues for businesses over €6M turnover. The 2023 Housing Law's zonas tensionadas provisions now fall under central government control, offering landlords up to 90% tax deductions for compliant long-term rentals. Residential rentals remain VAT-exempt, but tourist/commercial properties attract 10-21% IVA. Standard deductions include 3% annual amortization on buildings and full deduction of repairs up to gross rental income.

> **Gaps:** Specific list of 2025 declared zonas tensionadas beyond Catalonia; Non-EU landlord deduction rules post-2025 court ruling details; Crea y Crece B2B e-invoicing timeline.
>
> **Next research:** Monitor BOE for new zonas tensionadas declarations; Track RDL 15/2025 parliamentary validation; Review autonomous community-specific tax incentives.

## 3. 2023 Housing Law and Zonas Tensionadas

### Legal Basis

**Law 12/2023, of 24 May**, on the right to housing, establishes the framework for stressed rental market areas (zonas tensionadas).

### Definition Criteria

An area qualifies as a zona tensionada if it meets **at least one** condition:

1. **High economic effort**: Average housing cost (mortgage/rent + utilities) exceeds **30%** of average household income
2. **Price appreciation**: Housing prices increased at least **3 percentage points above CPI** over the past 5 years

### 2025 Changes

Starting in 2025, the **central government** controls designation of zonas tensionadas (previously regional authority). This aims to:
- Establish uniform national standards
- Accelerate implementation of housing affordability reforms
- Standardize tax deduction eligibility

### Rent Control Measures in Zonas Tensionadas

- Price regulation in new rental contracts
- Specific obligations for large landlords (>10 properties)
- Potential requirement to provide housing for social rent

### Landlord Tax Incentives (IRPF Deductions)

| Deduction | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| **90%** | New contracts with rent 5%+ below previous rent in zona tensionada |
| **70%** | First rental to tenant aged 18-35, or social housing rental |
| **60%** | Renovation completed in prior 3 years |
| **50%** | Standard long-term residential rental |

**Requirements for enhanced deductions:**
- Long-term rental (not tourist use)
- Located in officially declared zona tensionada
- Compliance with rental price limits

## 4. IVA (VAT) Rates for Rental Properties

| Mixed use (dwelling + office) | 21% |
| Lessee is a business/professional | 21% |
| Furnished with hotel-like services | 10% |

### Key Details

**Exempt rentals include:** furniture, garages, and annexes if leased jointly and specified in the contract.

**Exception for employee housing:** If a company leases property for employee use, the lease is exempt from IVA provided the contract identifies the occupant(s).

**Hotel-like services (10% IVA):** Applies when landlord provides cleaning, laundry, linen services, etc.

**Short-term tourist rentals:** Government has proposed applying 21% IVA (currently under consideration).
